    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish consisting of layers of flat pasta sheets, rich tomato sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and a hearty filling of ground meat, vegetables, and cheese. The layers are typically repeated several times and baked in the oven until the pasta is tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly. It's a comforting and satisfying dish that's perfect for feeding a crowd or for enjoying as leftovers the next day.</p>
